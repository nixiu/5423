We used a main training loop (see "LearningAgent.py") to integrate the OpenAI Gym with
E3AC algorithm. We then trained our agent to verify the performance.

2. Explanations to the files under "OpenAI Gym Codes Group 3" directory


"E3AC_Model" file: well trained network parameters of E3AC in scene3.

"Training Data" file:  all the training results we presented in our report.

"iiwa_scene3.ttt": the robotic scenarios we established in CoppeliaSim.

"Learning Agent Report.pdf":  our report that contains refelections, modifications on previous methods, and explanations to main codes. 

"LearningAgent.py":  our codes for the main training loop.

"Neural_Network_E3AC.py": our codes for the proposed E3AC algorithm.

"OpenAIGym.py": our codes for the environment.

"ou_noise": we downloaded it online, it is a code for random OU noise, which is used in E3AC.

"remoteApi.dll": supporting plugin (for Windows system) for communications between CoppeliaSim and python

"remoteApi.so": supporting plugin (for Ubantu system) for communications between CoppeliaSim and python

"sim.py" and "simConst.py": supporting libraries provided by CoppeliaSim containing various remoteAPI functions

**** "remoteApi.dll, remoteApi.so, sim.py, and simConst.py" must be put under the directory of our codes ****

3. Instructions â€” How to run our Learning Agent:

*** We established 3 scenes with different complexity***
*** In this assignment, we take Scene 3 (the most complex one) as the training environment***

Step 1: Ensure you have installed CoppeliaSim, and fulfill all the package requirements.
Step 2: Open "iiwa_scene3.ttt" file and run it. Click "ok" if there are any pop-up windows.
Step 3: Run "OpenAIGym.py" in python. 

***Note: CoppeliaSim must be run before OpenAIGym.py***
***Note the code is set to run testing episodes. Set "ON_TRAIN = True" (line 12) to run training episodes***
